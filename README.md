# java-projects

I have a background in Electrical Engineering, but found my true passion in creating things with programming.
As I develop a better foundation with Java, I will store some projects I found fun into this repository.
It should be interesting to see how this repository grows over time!
Although I have dabbled with programming on and off for a few years now, it is time to truly begin the journey to becoming an established software developer/engineer!
